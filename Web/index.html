    <h1 class="myHeader">Zoonotic Diseases</h1>
    <p class="myP">Animals provide many benefits to people. Many people interact with animals in their daily lives, both at home and away from home.
      Animals provide food, fiber, livelihoods, travel, sport, companionship, and education for people across the globe.
      Millions of households in the United States have one or more pets.
      We might come into contact with animals in either urban or rural settings, during travel,
      while visiting animal exhibits, or while enjoying outdoor activities.</p>
    <p class="myP">However, animals can sometimes carry harmful germs that can spread to people and cause illness – these are known as zoonotic diseases or zoonoses.
      Zoonotic diseases are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial, parasites, and fungi.
      These germs can cause many different types of illnesses in people and animals, ranging from mild to serious illness and even death.
      Animals can sometimes appear healthy even when they are carrying germs that can make people sick, depending on the zoonotic disease.</p>
    <h2 class="myHeader">Who is at a higher risk of serious illness from zoonotic diseases?</h2>
    <p class="myP">Anyone can get sick from a zoonotic disease, including healthy people.
      However, some people are more at risk than others and should take steps to protect themselves or family members.
      These people are more likely than others to get really sick, and even die, from infection with certain diseases.
      These groups of people include:</p>
    <ul class="myul">
      <li>Children younger than 5</li>
      <li>Adults older than 65</li>
      <li>People with weakened immune systems</li>
      <li>Pregnant women</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="myHeader">What can you do to protect yourself and your family from zoonotic diseases?</h2>
    <p class="myP">People can come in contact with animals in many places.
      This includes at home and away from home, in places like petting zoos, fairs, schools, stores, and parks.
      Insects, like mosquitoes and fleas, and ticks bite people and animals day and night.
      Thankfully, there are things you can do to protect yourself and your family from zoonotic diseases.</p>
      <ul class="myul">
        <li>Keep hands clean.
          Washing your hands right after being around animals, even if you didn’t touch any animals,
          is one of the most important steps you can take to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others.</li>
          <li>Know the simple things you can do to stay safe around your pets.</li>
          <li>Prevent bites from mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas.</li>
          <li>Learn more about ways to handle food safely—whether it’s for yourself or your family, your pet, or other animals.</li>
          <li>Be aware of zoonotic diseases both at home,
            away from home (such as at petting zoos or other animal exhibits),
            in childcare settings or schools and when you travel.</li>
          <li>Avoid bites and scratches from animals.</li>
      </ul>
